# Election-Trend-Prediction


This project focuses on predicting trends in the Indian MP Election 2019 dataset using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing historical election data, demographic information, and economic indicators, we aim to forecast future election outcomes and trends. 

The project involves data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and relationships. Feature engineering is conducted to extract relevant features for predictive modeling. Various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting are trained and evaluated to predict election trends accurately. 

The results are visualized to provide actionable insights for policymakers, analysts, and the public. Future enhancements may include incorporating real-time data sources and expanding the scope to analyze voter behavior and sentiment.
